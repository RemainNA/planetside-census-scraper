# Planetside Census Scraper

A collection of Python 3 scripts to automatically parse through and store information from the Planetside 2 Census API.

## Attribution

Arklur's API guide was used heavily as a reference for this project, and the query used in weapons.py was practically directly lifted from there.

## Usage

The program is designed to run in Python 3.  Most are called using `python3 [file] [Census Service ID]` All except for weapons.py can safely use the example service ID as they only make one request each.

The JSON files generated by these scripts are used in [Auraxis Bot](https://github.com/RemainNA/auraxis-bot).
